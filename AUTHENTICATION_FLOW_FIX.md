# Authentication Flow Fix

## Issue Description

Users who were added to the allowed users list by an admin were unable to login and received unclear error messages.

## Root Cause

The authentication system was designed with a two-step process:
1. Admin adds user to `allowed_users` table
2. User must **register first** before they can login

However, users were trying to login directly without registering, which caused confusion.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Messages in Login Flow

**File: `lib/auth.js`**
- Added intelligent error handling in `signInUser` function
- When login fails with "Invalid login credentials", the system now checks:
  - If user is in `allowed_users` table but hasn't registered yet → Shows helpful message to register first
  - If user is in `allowed_users` table and has registered → Shows password error message
  - If user is not in `allowed_users` table → Shows access denied message

### 2. Improved User Interface

**File: `pages/auth/login.js`**
- Added informational notice for new users
- Clear guidance to click "Sign Up" if they've been invited

**File: `pages/auth/register.js`**
- Enhanced messaging about invitation-only registration
- Clear instructions for invited users

### 3. Admin Diagnostic Tool

**File: `pages/admin/user-status-check.js`**
- New admin tool to check user status
- Helps admins troubleshoot login issues
- Shows detailed status of any user:
  - Whether they're in allowed users list
  - Whether they've registered
  - Whether they can login
  - Specific actions needed

## Authentication Flow (Corrected)

### For New Users:
1. **Admin adds user** to allowed users list via `/admin/allowed-users`
2. **User receives invitation** (optional email notification)
3. **User visits registration page** (`/auth/register`)
4. **User creates account** using the invited email address
5. **User verifies email** by clicking verification link
6. **User can now login** at `/auth/login`

### Error Messages Now Provided:

- **"You have been invited to join but need to register first. Please click 'Sign Up' and create your account using this email address."**
  - When: User is in allowed_users but hasn't registered
  - Action: User should go to registration page

- **"Invalid password. Please check your password or use 'Forgot Password' to reset it."**
  - When: User is registered but password is wrong
  - Action: User should check password or reset it

- **"Access denied. Please contact church administration to be added to the allowed users list."**
  - When: User is not in allowed_users list
  - Action: Contact admin to be added

- **"Please check your email and click the verification link before signing in."**
  - When: User registered but hasn't verified email
  - Action: Check email and click verification link

## Admin Tools

### User Status Check (`/admin/user-status-check`)
- Check any user's registration status
- See detailed breakdown of their authentication state
- Get specific instructions for resolving issues

### Allowed Users Management (`/admin/allowed-users`)
- Add new users to invitation list
- View all invited users
- See who has registered vs. who hasn't

## Testing the Fix

1. **Add a test user** via admin panel
2. **Try to login directly** → Should see helpful error message
3. **Register with the invited email** → Should work
4. **Verify email** → Should work
5. **Login** → Should work

## Key Files Modified

- `lib/auth.js` - Enhanced error handling
- `pages/auth/login.js` - Added user guidance
- `pages/auth/register.js` - Enhanced messaging
- `pages/admin/user-status-check.js` - New diagnostic tool
- `pages/admin/index.js` - Added link to diagnostic tool

## Benefits

1. **Clear user guidance** - Users know exactly what to do
2. **Reduced support burden** - Fewer confused users contacting admins
3. **Admin diagnostic tools** - Easy troubleshooting for admins
4. **Better user experience** - No more cryptic error messages
