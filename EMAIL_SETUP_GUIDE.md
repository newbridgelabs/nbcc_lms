# Email Notification System Setup Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Admin email changed to `newbridgelabs@gmail.com`
- Enhanced email service with comprehensive logging
- Created fallback email mechanisms
- Added email diagnostics page
- Improved error handling and debugging

❌ **Current Issue:**
EmailJS configuration requires additional setup in the EmailJS dashboard.

## Error Analysis

### Primary Issue
```
❌ Test email failed: The user ID is required. Visit https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/integration
```

This indicates that the EmailJS User ID needs to be properly configured in the EmailJS dashboard integration settings.

### Secondary Issue
```
API calls are disabled for non-browser applications
```

EmailJS free plan doesn't support server-side API calls, so we need to rely on client-side email sending.

## Required EmailJS Setup Steps

### 1. Visit EmailJS Dashboard
Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/integration

### 2. Configure Integration Settings
- Ensure your User ID is properly set up
- Verify the integration is active
- Check that your account is not suspended

### 3. Verify Email Service
- Go to Email Services tab
- Ensure your email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) is connected
- Test the connection

### 4. Check Email Template
Your template should include these variables:
- `{{to_email}}` - recipient email
- `{{to_name}}` - recipient name
- `{{subject}}` - email subject
- `{{message}}` - email message body
- `{{pdf_url}}` - PDF download link
- `{{agreement_id}}` - agreement ID

### 5. Publish Template
- Ensure your template is published (not in draft mode)
- Test the template with sample data

## Current Configuration

**Environment Variables:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_6p2szkk
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_h0ekplo
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_USER_ID=vjXyYpLgDibpvaLPL
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=newbridgelabs@gmail.com
```

## Testing the Email System

### 1. Use Email Diagnostics Page
- Go to Admin Dashboard
- Click "Email Diagnostics"
- Run the diagnostic test
- Follow the troubleshooting guide

### 2. Use Test Email Button
- Go to Admin Dashboard
- Click "Test Email Service"
- Check console for detailed logs
- Verify email delivery

## Email Flow When Working

### Agreement Approval Process:
1. Admin approves agreement
2. PDF is generated and uploaded
3. **User Email** sent to member:
   - Congratulations message
   - PDF download link
   - Welcome message
4. **Admin Email** sent to `newbridgelabs@gmail.com`:
   - Member details
   - Agreement information
   - Confirmation of user notification

## Troubleshooting Steps

### If emails still don't work after EmailJS setup:

1. **Check EmailJS Account Status**
   - Verify account is active
   - Check quota limits
   - Ensure no billing issues

2. **Verify Template Configuration**
   - Template must be published
   - All variables must be properly mapped
   - Test template with sample data

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for detailed error messages
   - Check network tab for failed requests
   - Verify EmailJS initialization

4. **Test with Simple Template**
   - Create a basic template with minimal variables
   - Test with simple message
   - Gradually add complexity

1. **Supabase Edge Functions** with email service
