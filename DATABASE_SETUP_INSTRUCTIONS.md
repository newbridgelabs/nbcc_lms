# Database Setup Instructions

## ✅ Registration Error Fixed!

The registration error has been fixed and your app now works without requiring the database setup. However, to enable full functionality (email verification, user profiles, etc.), follow these steps:

## 🗄️ Setting Up the Database Tables

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your NBCC LMS project

### Step 2: Open SQL Editor
1. In the left sidebar, click on **"SQL Editor"**
2. Click **"New Query"** to create a new SQL script

### Step 3: Copy and Run the SQL
1. Open the `database-setup.sql` file in your project
2. **Select all the content** (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
3. **Copy it** (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
4. **Paste it** into the Supabase SQL Editor (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
5. Click **"Run"** to execute the SQL

### Step 4: Verify Setup
After running the SQL, you should see:
- ✅ 4 tables created (users, pdf_sections, user_progress, agreements)
- ✅ Row Level Security policies applied
- ✅ Indexes created for performance
- ✅ Trigger function created for automatic user profile creation

## 🎉 What This Enables

Once the database is set up, you'll have:

- **✅ User Profiles**: Custom user data storage
- **✅ Email Verification**: Proper verification workflow
- **✅ Progress Tracking**: Track user progress through materials
- **✅ Agreements**: Store signed membership agreements
- **✅ Security**: Row Level Security for data protection

## 🚀 Current Status

**Without database setup:**
- ✅ User registration works
- ✅ Authentication works
- ✅ Basic app functionality works
- ⚠️ Email verification is simulated
- ⚠️ No user profiles stored

**With database setup:**
- ✅ Everything above PLUS
- ✅ Real email verification
- ✅ User profiles and progress tracking
- ✅ Full LMS functionality

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Permission Error**: Make sure you're the owner of the Supabase project
2. **SQL Error**: Check that you copied the entire SQL content
3. **Table Already Exists**: If tables exist, you can skip this setup
4. **Need Help**: The app works without this setup, so you can always set it up later

## 📝 Note

The registration form will continue to show a helpful notice about database setup until you complete this process. Once done, the notice will disappear and full functionality will be enabled.
