# Authentication Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ❌ Admin Name Showing During User Registration
**Problem**: When users tried to register, they saw "Welcome, Madagala Prasanna Paul" (admin name) in the header.

**Root Cause**: Admin session was persisting when users visited registration pages.

**✅ Solution**: 
- Modified `components/Layout.js` to hide user info on auth pages (`/auth/*`)
- Added `isAuthPage` check to prevent showing user navigation on login/register pages
- Users now see clean auth pages without admin session info

### 2. ❌ Incorrect User Guidance Text
**Problem**: Login page said "click 'Sign Up'" but the actual button said "Register here"

**✅ Solution**: 
- Updated text in `pages/auth/login.js` to say "click 'Register here'" for consistency

### 3. ❌ Registration Failing for Allowed Users
**Problem**: Users added to allowed_users list couldn't register due to database RLS policies

**Root Cause**: `allowed_users` table had RLS policies that only allowed admins to read it, but during registration, users are not authenticated yet.

**✅ Solution**: 
- Created secure database functions that bypass RLS:
  - `check_allowed_user(email)` - Check if user can register
  - `mark_allowed_user_used(email)` - Mark invitation as used
  - `check_all_allowed_users(email)` - For login error handling
- Updated `lib/auth.js` to use these functions instead of direct table queries
- Functions have `SECURITY DEFINER` to run with elevated privileges

### 4. ❌ Poor Error Messages During Login
**Problem**: Users got cryptic "Invalid login credentials" without guidance

**✅ Solution**: 
- Enhanced error handling in `signInUser` function
- Now provides specific messages:
  - "You have been invited to join but need to register first..." (for invited but not registered)
  - "Invalid password. Please check your password..." (for registered users with wrong password)
  - "Access denied. Please contact church administration..." (for users not in allowed list)

## Files Modified

### Core Authentication
- `lib/auth.js` - Enhanced error handling and RPC function usage
- `components/Layout.js` - Hide user info on auth pages

### User Interface
- `pages/auth/login.js` - Updated guidance text
- `pages/auth/register.js` - Already had good messaging

### Admin Tools
- `pages/admin/user-status-check.js` - New diagnostic tool
- `pages/admin/fix-registration.js` - Database fix utility
- `pages/admin/index.js` - Added links to new tools

### Database
- `sql/fix-registration-access.sql` - Database functions for secure registration

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Apply Database Functions
1. Go to `/admin/fix-registration` in your admin panel
2. Click "Execute SQL" or copy the SQL and run it manually in Supabase SQL Editor

### Step 2: Test the Flow
1. **Admin adds user** to allowed users list
2. **User visits registration page** (should see clean interface without admin name)
3. **User registers** with invited email (should work now)
4. **User verifies email** via email link
5. **User can login** successfully

### Step 3: Troubleshoot Issues
- Use `/admin/user-status-check` to diagnose any user issues
- Check specific user status and get actionable instructions

## Current Authentication Flow (Fixed)

```
1. Admin adds user to allowed_users table
   ↓
2. User visits /auth/register (clean interface, no admin session visible)
   ↓
3. User fills registration form with invited email
   ↓
4. System checks allowed_users via secure RPC function ✅
   ↓
5. User account created in Supabase Auth
   ↓
6. User receives verification email
   ↓
7. User clicks verification link
   ↓
8. User can login at /auth/login
   ↓
9. If login fails, user gets helpful error message with next steps
```
