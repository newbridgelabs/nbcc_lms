## 🚀 Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. Set Up Supabase (Free Database & Auth)

1. **Create Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Click "Start your project"
   - Create a new organization and project

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Go to Settings > API
   - Copy your Project URL and anon public key
   - Update `.env.local` with your actual values:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
   ```

3. **Set Up Database Tables**
   - Go to SQL Editor in Supabase
   - Run the SQL commands from the README.md file to create tables

4. **Configure Google OAuth (Optional)**
   - In Supabase: Authentication > Providers > Google
   - Add your Google OAuth credentials

### 2. Deploy to Vercel (Free Hosting)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial church LMS setup"
   git remote add origin your-github-repo-url
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Deploy!

### 3. Upload Study Materials

Currently, the system expects PDF sections to be uploaded by an administrator. You have two options:

**Option A: Manual Database Insert (Temporary)**
- Upload your 30-page PDF to Supabase Storage
- Use the PDF splitting utility to create 5 sections
- Insert section records into the database

**Option B: Admin Interface (Recommended)**
- I can create an admin interface for uploading and managing PDFs
- This would be a separate admin dashboard

### 4. Configure Email Delivery

The system is ready for email integration. You can:
- Use EmailJS (free tier: 200 emails/month)
- Use Supabase Edge Functions
- Integrate with SendGrid or similar service
